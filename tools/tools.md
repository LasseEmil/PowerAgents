# AI Developer Tools

This directory provides a list of notable AI-powered developer tools. We separate them into two broad categories:

- **Agentic CLI Tools** – command-line interfaces that run autonomous agents against your codebase.
- **AI-Integrated Development Environments** – IDEs with built-in agents or copilots that operate across entire projects.

The bullet list below demonstrates how each entry might be rendered using the Jinja template in `tool_template.jinja`.
